      <h3>Fullstack Academy</h3>
      <p>I decided to join a six-month bootcamp to further my knowledge and skills in
         programming. Over the course of the program, I had the opportunity to learn
          a wide variety of languages, including React, Express, Git, JavaScript, and Node.js.
           With the help and guidance of experienced mentors, I gained valuable insights 
           into software development and learned how to work proficiently in a team.
            This bootcamp was a crucial step in my journey as a programmer, and I am grateful
             for the skills and experience I gained there.

      <h3>Montana State University</h3>
      <p>While attending Montana State, I had the opportunity to pursue my passion 
        for programming through a few classes. It was during this time that I discovered 
        my love for coding, and I knew that I wanted to further my education and career in 
        this field. Thanks to the solid foundation I gained at Montana State, I was able to 
        graduate with an associate's degree and embark on a fulfilling journey as a programmer.
